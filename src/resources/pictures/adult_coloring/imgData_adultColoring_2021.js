These lightning-fast little fellows are true markers of summers days, which we also have to say farewell to when they leave.<br /><br />This design was inspired by these times, when seasons are changing as well as our bird neighbours: winter visitors are arriving, and our summer friends are taking their leaves. The design was made to become a tshirt pattern, but I made it available as an adult colouring page as well.',

      "Why stop at a book-sized colouring page? Let's colour this giant poster featuring a heron, trouts, splashes of water and a willow tree, inspired by the Irish riversides. The poster is available in 3 sizes: 21×30cm (about A4 size), 30 x 40 cm (about A3 size), and 50 x 70 cm (about A2 size).<br /><br />Paper weight is 192 g/m², which is a decent paper weight for most medium. The poster is suitable for coloured pencils, markers, watercolour pencils, watercolour markers and even watercolour paints if applied with a moderate amount of water. The surface is a smooth matte finish.<br /><br />The artwork was inspired my walks along the beautiful Irish rivers: the Boyne, the Barrow, the Avonmore, and the Royal Canal. Grey herons are common residents along these waters and it's always a pleasure to see them hunting for fish. I wanted to capture this essence of the riverside in this picture, a connection to water that is very different from one to the sea.",
