      "I was thinking about naming this painting 'Opponent Process Theory' as green and red are two of the most contrasting colours. There's no greenish red or reddish green, it's either or. In psychology an example to this theory is when you're afraid of something, but you still keep doing it, your brain must resolve the situation somehow, so eventually you either give up doing the thing, or you won't be afraid of it anymore. The two can't exist alongside, so you change.<br /><br />So how does green and red work together? They have different qualities and when you put these two together something new must come to life.",

      "The title means \"deterioration with age\" and is usually used in biology to describe when flowers change colour over the lifecycle of their blooming. Is this deterioration really? I'd call it maturing. We don't think ourselves as being deteriorating as we grow up, it's just a change, something that was becomes something new. Maybe something better. The red primroses turn into yellow ones.<br /><br />And the griffin, a heraldic animal of valour and leadership, but also of longevity and loyalty, gets caught in the change. It's definitely not deterioration, it's just a change.",
