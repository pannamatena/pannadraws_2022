In psychology an example to this theory is when you're afraid of something, but you still keep doing it, your brain must resolve the situation somehow, so eventually you either give up doing the thing, or you won't be afraid of it anymore. The two can't exist alongside, so you change.<br /><br />So how does green and red work together? They have different qualities and when you put these two together something new must come to life.",
