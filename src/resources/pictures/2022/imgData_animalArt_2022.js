I have a folder full of leftover pieces I just find too valuable to throw away.<br /><br />When I mounted <i>Curls</i> I had this nice leftover piece of heavy mounting board that I cut from the inside of the mount. It's an inverse, so it felt like some plaque... and it was pure white. Of course I had to save it!<br /><br />This gyrfalcon I encountered in Sligo at a birds of prey centre. Being such a majestic bird I thought he would fit this 'plaque' and the colours of the reference photos I took were also perfect for an experiment with liquid pencils. I mixed these with traditional watercolours to give some depth at some places, and also mixed a special shade of dark blue for the ink lines.",
