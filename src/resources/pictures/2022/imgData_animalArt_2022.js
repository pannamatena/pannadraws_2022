      'This is a painting I made as an entry to the yearly World Curlew Day Art and Poetry competition organised by Curlew Action, an organisation dedicated to the conservation of nesting curlews in the UK and Ireland.<br /><br />Although curlews are a common sight, nesting pairs are disappearing from the Irish and British shores as their nesting grounds are no longer safe. The profits from selling this painting go to fund the hard work Curlew Action is doing.<br /><br />The painting was named after the shore of Bull Island where I see most of the curlews I encounter.',

      "This magpie started out as a quicky based on an idea I had about the floral elements planned for a larger piece.<br /><br />I've dug into the matter of Irish butterflies too, and picked the amazing red admiral to add some spice to this painting. I'm not very much into insects, except when it comes to butterflies, bees/bumblebees and grasshoppers, so I'm going to make these guys part of my artworks more often.<br /><br />The plants pictured here are heavily influenced by the native Irish forests, especially the Rowan tree that I love with its red berries.",

This is something I'd like to discover more as the core of this type of art is very much the same as my reason for painting: to capture the soul and spirit of the living world!",

      'Like most of the best stories the story of "Affection" was written by life. When I was about 8-9 I was encouraged to participate in school drawing contests. There was a contest at Valentine\'s Day themed "Love", of course. All my classmates drew hearts and doves and pink things, but being the one who was into dinosaurs (I knew the Latin name for every breed, a real geek!) while others wanted princesses I took a different path: to me love was a deer being licked by another. Affection.',
